# TestDriveBooking

TestDriveBooking is a mobile application developed using React Native, which provides a seamless experience for booking test drives for cars. This project leverages the power of React Native's component-based architecture and integrates a reusable UI library to enhance the user interface design. Additionally, Redux is utilized for efficient state management across the application.

## Features

- **React Native:** The application is built using React Native, enabling cross-platform development for both iOS and Android.
- **Reusable UI Library:** We utilize reusable components from a UI library to maintain consistency and improve development efficiency.
- **Redux State Management:** Redux is employed to manage the application's state, ensuring a predictable and centralized state architecture.
